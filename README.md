# showcase site for a young nail technician setting up in early 2023

## Website 

- This website is made of HTML and pure CSS. I have used Vite.js as a developement server to test the code and also to use prettier end eslint.

## What is Vite.js ?

- Vite.js is a front-end build tool that aims to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use. It is designed to be a replacement for tools like webpack, with a focus on simplicity and performance. Vite.js uses native ES module imports and has built-in support for JSX, TypeScript, and other modern language features. It is also highly configurable, allowing you to customize the build process to suit your needs.
- Vite.js is built on top of the native ES module system, which means it does not require a bundler like webpack to resolve and optimize module imports. This makes it faster and easier to use, as you don't have to configure and maintain a complex bundler configuration.
- Vite.js supports JSX, TypeScript, and other modern language features out of the box. This means you can write your code using these languages and Vite.js will automatically transpile and polyfill your code as needed for compatibility with older browsers.
- Vite.js has a built-in development server that supports hot module replacement (HMR). This means you can make changes to your code and see the updates in your browser in real-time, without having to manually refresh the page.
- Vite.js has a plugin system that allows you to customize the build process and add additional functionality. For example, you can use plugins to transpile additional languages, optimize images, or add support for additional file types.

#### Overall, Vite.js is a lightweight and easy-to-use build tool that is well-suited for modern front-end development.

# Deploy and update
